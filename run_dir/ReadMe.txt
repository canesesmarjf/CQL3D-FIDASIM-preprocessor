WHAM_wall_cold_neutral_source:
==============================
This was created on 2024-12-03 where we are producing a neutral wall flux from the vacuum vessel.
The vaccuum vessel is describe by an R-Z profile over various segments.
The neutral particles are emitted from the surface with a cosine distribution normal to the surface and
with a Maxwellian distribution in velocities at the surface temperature.
