  # Script Name:  submit_PERLMUTTER.sh
  #
  # Purpose:
  #   Submit a SLURM batch job on NERSC Perlmutter using either run_CQL3D.sh
  #   or run_FIDASIM.sh, depending on which one is present in the current
  #   working directory. Automatically sets the SLURM job name based on the
  #   directory name and routes logs to the ./logs folder.
  #
  # Usage:
  #   ./submit_PERLMUTTER.sh
  #
  # Notes:
  #   - Must be run on a Perlmutter login node (NERSC_HOST=perlmutter)
  #   - Only one of run_CQL3D.sh or run_FIDASIM.sh must be present
  #   - If both exist, the script will abort with a warning
  #   - SLURM logs are saved to logs/<jobname>-<jobid>.out and .err
